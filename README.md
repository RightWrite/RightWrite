### ‚úçüèª - Welcome to RightWrite's Profile - ‚úçüèª
Surprisingly, I‚Äôm not a software developer. 

I‚Äôm a published author & copyeditor/proofreader with 18 years of experience writing, editing, & publishing nonfiction works. My books, that appear on major publishing platforms, have superb reviews.

In late 2024 I started discovering many grammatical & structural errors in app descriptions on both *Google Play* & *F-Droid* repos. So, I signed up for GitHub. 

Currently, I‚Äôm available for projects that will benefit from proper English grammar.

The specific areas where I can be of service include:

- *README.md* content creation/optimization & formatting
- app descriptions on *F-Droid* & *Google Play*
- app wikis & PDFs

Regarding *README.md* files, I can craft magnificent written pieces geared toward a general English-speaking audience, or any specific audience you choose. Besides that, I can write or optimize existing app descriptions for app stores, such as *Google Play* & *F-Droid*. 

A properly written app description will increase the chances of potential users downloading your app; while a poorly formed description will deter them.

Eventually, I‚Äôll delve into the creation of app wikis & PDF manuals. Although, this is a future endeavor because I‚Äôm still learning how to navigate GitHub, as of February 2025.

My service is especially useful to those whose native language isn‚Äôt English. Yet, even if English is your first language, I can refine your writing.

I look forward to helping you transform your app description into a work of art.

Feel free to drop me a line.
