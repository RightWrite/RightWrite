## Welcome to My Profile
Surprisingly, I'm not a developer. I'm a writer & copyeditor/proofreader.

I discovered lots of grammatical & structural errors in app descriptions on both Google Play & F-Droid repos. So, I signed up for GitHub. 

I'm available for projects that will benefit from proper English grammar.

I'm looking forward to helping software developers transform their writing into a work of art.
